# Genderstanding
My goal in creating Genderstanding is to provide a space to discuss gender identity in a positive manner and increase understanding in a space that is traditionally marked by conflict. This app was originally created as a small, anonymous platform that those in my life could ask me questions about gender identity if they were feeling unable / not sure how to do so.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (EJS, Express), MongoDB

The first iteration of Genderstanding was built using the templating language EJS. As this little app's ambitions have grown and I have received feedback about this project, I am not refactoring this project to run on the MERN stack with a React front-end.

## Optimizations

My current to-do list:
- Styling for main page
- Flesh out header sections -- many of the styling elements need to be optimized.
-   Profile settings
-   About
-   Donate
-   FAQ
-   Demographic badges
- OAuth only from Google/FB for better accountability of users.
- Threads
- Consideration for editing: perhaps a timeframe will work best to prevent abuse.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first project to fully utilize Tailwind CSS and also includes some EJS functionality that I have not placed into any project before. Because of the sensitive nature surrounding Gender Identity, I am choosing to use Passport.JS to lean on OAuth from other entities to increase user accountability and allowing anonymous questions to be asked at tjhis time. Overall, the project has been a great exercise and has improved my life as well as those around me.
